# Job Application Tracker
I'm creating this simple CRUD application with MERN stack to keep track with my current job applications.

It's still a work in progress...

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install this application.

```bash
cd job-application-tracker/
npm install
cd client/
npm install
cd ../server/
npm install
```

## To run the app
```bash
cd job-application-tracker/
npm run dev
```
